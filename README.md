# BattleShip

In this project we have developed the battleship game for 1 player vs Computer.


Initially totalhits is the sum of the health of the ships.
When there is a hit totalhits is decremented by 1.

player with totalHits == 0 wins.

When ever an unexpected condition is met CustomExceptiom is thrown

**Example:

Player's hit: Submarine is hit and remaining health 1 hits remainig :15
Computer's hit: Your Submarine	is hit and health 2

**Console outputs in OUTPUT.TXT.

**NOTE: Results starting with 'Your' are the hits made by the computer and the coordinates are generated randomly using Random
